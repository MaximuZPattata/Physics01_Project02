# About

- A simple scene with a complex mesh object containing a number of vertices and triangles. Tie-Fighter is moved around to check for collision. AABBs and narrow phase detection implemented. 

## How to run

- The solution "PhysicsProject.sln" needs to be built(either in Debug or Release). The project "DummyMain" should be set as startup project. Now the project can be run.

### Controls

- Up, Left and Right arrow keys to control the TieFighter in th scene.
